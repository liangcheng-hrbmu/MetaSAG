        # MetaSAG
        
        
        ## What is it?
        
        In a single sample, **single-cell microbial genome droplet sequencing technology** can generate tens of thousands of droplet short-read sequencing data at a time.
        **MetaSAG** enables **efficient and easy** procedural bioinformatics analysis of large raw sequencing data.

        ## Main Features
        - Here are just a few of the things that AAA does well:
        
          - According to the distribution of short reading segments of droplets in the sample,
            low-quality droplets are removed, and the soft threshold is more scientific.
          - The classification and annotation of a single cell are flexible, and it is not
            necessary to rely on the similarity between cells for clustering.
          - Annotation method has interpretable biological significance.
          - Annotations depend on [**MetaPhlAn4**][MetaPhlAn4].
          - Multi-cell droplets and unknown classified droplets can be identified.
          - The definition of cell category is flexible, and the default threshold or custom threshold can be used.
          - Assembling genomes of known classified cell boxes is efficient and accurate.
          - The main phage viruses in the sample can be identified.
          - Streamlined downstream functional analysis (phylogenetic tree, SNP classification strain, HGT level gene transfer)
          - According to Uniref90 features and using [**HuMann3 Tool**][HuMann3], the designated cells are clustered, and the similarity between
            cell clusters is analyzed from the functional point of view.
